![Demo](readme_assets/app-demo.gif)

## About Dataset

### Context

The [heart attack datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/heart-attack-dataset/data) were collected at Zheen hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January 2019 to May 2019. The attributes of this dataset are: age, gender, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, ck-mb and troponin with negative or positive output. According to the provided information, the medical dataset classifies either heart attack or none. The gender column in the data is normalized: the male is set to 1 and the female to 0. The glucose column is set to 1 if it is > 120; otherwise, 0. As for the output, positive is set to 1 and negative to 0.

### Dataset Glossary (Column-wise)

## Project Structure

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivekpatel99/heart-attack-predictor-end-to-end-ml-project.git
   cd heart-attack-predictor-end-to-end-ml-project
   ```

   *(Note: The project structure is assumed to be pre-generated, potentially using a `template.py` script as mentioned in development steps.)*

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (using `uv`)/Setup Project Environment:**

   *First, ensure you have `uv` installed. If not, follow the instructions here.*

   ```bash
   # uv will create a virtual environment named .venv and install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB Atlas:**

   - Sign up/log in to MongoDB Atlas.
   - Create a new project.
   - Create a free tier (M0) cluster.
   - Configure a database user (username/password).
   - Go to "Network Access" and add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from any IP (for development; restrict in production).
   - Go to your cluster > "Connect" > "Drivers" > Select Python (3.6 or later).
   - Copy the connection string.

4. **Set up AWS:**

   - Log in to your AWS Console.
   - **IAM User:**
     - Go to IAM > Users > Create user (e.g., `heartattack-dev-user`).
     - Attach policies: `AdministratorAccess` (for ease of setup, consider more restrictive policies for production).
     - Create access key (select "Command Line Interface (CLI)") and download/copy the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
   - **S3 Bucket:**
     - Go to S3 > Create bucket.
     - Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., `yourname-heartattack-models`).
     - Select the region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
     - Uncheck "Block all public access" and acknowledge (needed for simple deployment setup; review security implications).
     - Create the bucket.

5. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   - **Method 1: `.env` file (Recommended for Local Development)**

     - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
     - Add your credentials and configurations:

     ```dotenv
     # .env
     MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
     AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # Or your chosen region
     # Add other necessary variables like DB_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME, BUCKET_NAME if needed by the code
     # BUCKET_NAME="yourname-heartattack-models"
     ```

     - *Note: Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file. If you are using `uv run`, `uv` will automatically load variables from a `.env` file in the current or parent directories, so manual exporting might not be necessary when running scripts via `uv run`.*
     - The application code needs to be configured to load variables from `.env` (e.g., using `python-dotenv`).

   - **Method 2: Exporting Variables (Common for Terminals/CI/CD)**

     - **Bash/Zsh:**

     ```bash
     export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@..."
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
     export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
     # Check: echo $MONGODB_URL
     ```

     - **PowerShell:**

     ```powershell
     $env:MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@..."
     $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
     $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
     $env:AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
     # Check: echo $env:MONGODB_URL
     ```

     - **Windows CMD (or System Environment Variables GUI):**

     ```cmd
     set MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@..."
     set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
     # ... etc
     ```

6. **Run the Project**

   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Push new changes to AWS**

   - First uncomment code from [Github Actions](.github/workflows/aws.yaml) for AWS.
   - the commit and push your changes. Github Action will automatically build and deploy project on `EC2` instance.

## 💾 Data Handling

- **Dataset Loading:** The initial dataset (from Kaggle) should be placed appropriately (e.g., in a `data/` or `notebooks/` directory).
- **MongoDB Upload:** Use the provided Jupyter notebook (e.g., `notebooks/mongoDB_demo.ipynb`) to upload the dataset to your configured MongoDB Atlas database.
- **Data Ingestion:** The pipeline's `DataIngestion` component reads data from MongoDB.

## 🏋️ Running the Training Pipeline

- Ensure your environment variables are set correctly (MongoDB URL, AWS Keys).
- Execute the main training pipeline script (e.g., `python main.py` or `python demo.py` - adjust command based on your project's entry point).
- This script orchestrates the following components:
  1. **Data Ingestion:** Fetches data from MongoDB.
  2. **Data Validation:** Checks data against a predefined schema (`config/schema.yaml`).
  3. **Data Transformation:** Performs preprocessing and feature engineering.
  4. **Model Training:** Trains the machine learning model.
  5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model against metrics and potentially a baseline model from S3.
  6. **Model Pusher:** If the model meets evaluation criteria, pushes the model artifacts (model file, preprocessor) to the configured AWS S3 bucket.
